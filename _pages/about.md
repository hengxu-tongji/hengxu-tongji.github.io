I am a PhD student in Surveying and Mapping Science and Technology at Tongji University, under the supervision of [Dr. Wei Huang](https://huangweibuct.github.io/weihuang.github.io/). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from Tongji University in 2024. My research interests lie at the intersection of Trustworthy Machine Learning and Data-Centric AI. Specifically, my current work focuses on modeling data annotation quality and label noise, and exploring their applications in city-related data. If you want to know more about me, please read my [resume](https://hengxu-tongji.github.io/files/resume.pdf).
