I am a PhD student in Surveying and Mapping Science and Technology at Tongji University, under the supervision of [Dr. Wei Huang](https://huangweibuct.github.io/weihuang.github.io/). Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from Tongji University in 2024. My research interests lie at the applications of Trustworthy Machine Learning and Data-Centric AI within urban analysis. Specifically, my current work focuses on modeling data annotation quality and label noise, and exploring their applications in city-related data. If you want to know more about me, please read my [resume](https://hengxu-tongji.github.io/files/heng-xu-resume-template.pdf).

You can explore the details and code for my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/hengxu-tongji).
